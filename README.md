## Overview
- A multipurpose desktop robotic arm for practical training and instruction is called DOBOT Magician. 
- When it is equipped with various end-tools, it can carry out fascinating tasks like 3D printing, laser engraving, writing, and sketching. 
- With over 20 programming languages and 13 extendable interfaces to promote secondary development, it truly allows your ideas and creativity to grow without bounds.
- It is low cost, small size, and easy operation, which allows every student to practice on their own. It improves the teaching efficiency dramatically. It can be controlled by Programming, APP, Bluetooth, WiFi, Mouse, and more.
- It applies to major international standards like CE, RoHS, ERP, FCC, KC, PSE, TELEC, etc.
- It is compatible to develop user applications with its 13 I/O ports, API, and released protocols. It can be developed with several programming languages, ROS, PLC, Microcontroller and Arduino.
