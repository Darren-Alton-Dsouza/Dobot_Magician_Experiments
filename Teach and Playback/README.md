# Teach and Playback
A system to teach the Dobot Magician how to move. It enables the Dobot Magician to accomplish recorded movements by manual taught control.

In this experiment the robot has been manoeuvred using a hand guided mode of operation. 
The robot has been taught to move to various positions in its workspace ( Five input positions here ). 
The robot then follows these waypoints on commanding it through playback function.  

**Step 1:** Launch Dobot Studio, connect to the Dobot Magician (refer [Initial Setup](../Initial%20Setup/README.md)) and click on 'Teaching & Playback'. This enables the Teach and Playback mode of the robot.

**Step 2:** The Teach and Playback Interface can be seen in the figure below. It helps us control each joint of the Dobot Magician and move it about the positive x,y and z axis as well as negative x,y and z axis. An option to enable a particular type of gripper is provided in this section too.
