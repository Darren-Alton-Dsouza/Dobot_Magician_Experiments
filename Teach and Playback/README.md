# Teach and Playback
A system to teach the Dobot Magician how to move. It enables the Dobot Magician to accomplish recorded movements by manual taught control.

In this experiment the robot has been manoeuvred using a hand guided mode of operation. 
The robot has been taught to move to various positions in its workspace ( Five input positions here ). 
The robot then follows these waypoints on commanding it through playback function.  

**Step 1:** Launch Dobot Studio, connect to the Dobot Magician (refer [Initial Setup](../Initial%20Setup/README.md)) and click on 'Teaching & Playback'
